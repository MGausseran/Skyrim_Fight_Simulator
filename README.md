# Skyrim Fight Simulator

Welcome to the **Skyrim Fight Simulator**, a fun and dynamic project coded entirely in JavaScript! This project lets you select two characters from the Skyrim universe and watch them battle to the death. Whether itâ€™s a mighty Dragonborn versus Alduin, or Lydia bravely facing a Frost Troll, the choice is yours!

## Features

- **100 unique characters** from the Skyrim universe, each with their own stats, weapons, and combat styles.  
- **Dynamic fight simulation**: Characters trade blows, with mechanics for dodging, critical hits, and varying attack strengths.  
- **Immersive experience** with visuals, sound effects, and randomized combat outcomes.  
- Practice **DOM manipulation** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in JavaScript.

## How It Works

### **Character Selection**

- Select from a list of characters filtered by type.  

### **Stat Display**
